#Description
Clone or unzip this repository to your Sublime 3 Packages directory (default is User/AppData/Roaming/SublimeText3/Packages)

Ctrl+shift+p -> "Newest Challenge" will create a new directory and create a new file with prepared boilerplate (file name and contents are editable in the script).

Ctrl+shift+p -> "Old Challenge" will let you choose from all existing challenges.

If the directory was already created, the script will simply open the main file, so you can easily jump to solved challenges.
